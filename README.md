# Simple chrome plugin that disables facebook features
Remove distracting features from facebook. It's mainly developed for personal use, because I'm just using facebook messenger, but sometimes I enter facebook's main page and I get distracted by either scrolling the news feed or videos.

## Videos
Removes videos button from the menu. Also removes videos from the DOM if page is manually entered.

## News feed
Removes news feed from the DOM
